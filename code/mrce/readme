(1) use "./run_mrce_preparation.sh fasttext 128" to prepare the training and testing data
- the first parameter is dataset name
- the second is the dimension of each high-dimensional object in the dataset

(2) use "python train.py fasttext fasttext_model.bin 128 0"
- the first parameter is the dataset name
- the second one is the path to store the trained model
- the third is the dimension of each high-dimensional object in the dataset
- the forth is which GPU to be used for training
